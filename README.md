## Why are covert implants so powerful? 

When attempting a physical penetration test it is sometimes difficult to find the opportunity to place an implant. A beautiful example of a clandestine device is the O.MG Cable.  All a tester needs are a business card, a new suit and finally a slew of 'Goody bags' and the targets will happily plug in your device and the party is on. 

## Where implants fail

Security administrators are looking for these covert implants now. The marker revolution gave us the ability to access cheap and powerful hardware that twenty or thirty years ago would have only been in the toolbox of nation state operators. This democratization has placed these types of tools in the hands of everyone for better or for worse.
Since Security administrators are at least aware of these devices now, there is an increased suspicion around any type of device that is attached to a user's station. 


## Solution? 

In order bypass this increased suspicion by technical personnel, an implant needs to focus on areas that do not interact with the targetâ€™s workstation at all.  

## Requirements

Building your own implants can be an exhausting and expensive endeavor, I consider the following questions essential when designing an implant.

-  How much negative space is in the host device? (Imagine attempting to conceal a Raspberry Pi 4 in a pencil!)
-  How will it be powered?  (If there is not much negative space, you can't use a large battery)
-  How will you control the device remotely? 
-  What will it accomplish? (Single feature devices are smaller, and generally require less power, but can be more expensive))
-  How cheap can you make each unit? 

Generally, you cannot make a device that checks all five boxes without spending a small fortune developing it.
